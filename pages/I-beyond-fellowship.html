	<h1>The fellowship<br />was just the start.</h1>
</div>

<h2>The Code for America fellowship is about more than building software applications for cities.  Its about proving that government can move at the speed of citizens, can speak the language of citizens, and can cost what citizens are willing to pay.  It’s about a culture of creativity and can-do within government and public servants who care deeply about using today’s tools to truly serve the public.</h2>

<h2>But the fellowship is not enough.</h2>

<h2>A thriving ecosystem for civic innovation requires engaged and active communities, a healthy marketplace, and a support system for innovators inside governments.</h2>

<h2>So in 2012, Code for America not only expanded from three fellowship cities to eight. We also launched three new programs.
