<h3>Building Community as Capacity</h3>
<div class="line"></div>
<p>We rolled out the brigade so we could help provide local municipalities with 
community members who were able to act as additional capacity in much needed times. These brigades take the form of small, local civic groups who work hand and hand with the community and city hall to build apps that address civic needs.</p>
