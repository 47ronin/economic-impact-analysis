<h3>Building Community as Capacity</h3>
<div class="line"></div>
<p>The <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/" target="_blank">CfA Brigade</a> organizes and supports networks of volunteer “civic hackers” to work with local governments to open data, implement civic software, and use the web as a platform for civic engagement. In times of shrinking budgets and higher demands on government, it's key for the community to act as additional capacity for cities.</p>
