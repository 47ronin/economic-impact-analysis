            <p class="dropdown-menu" role="button" aria-labelledby="innovation">By 2013 over 13 cities around the country had created offices or high-level roles focused on innovation (i.e. Office of New Urban Mechanics, Chief Innovation Officer). These serve as ongoing spaces for experimentation, building new skill sets, opening data, engaging the community, and demonstrating new ways of leveraging technology that can serve citizens better and save money.</p>

During these coordinated weekends, citizens and governments convened at dozens of events to build beta apps, liberate datasets and hold write-a-thons. Nine brigade members were then honored with an invitation to a White House Champions of Change celebrating the National Day of Civic Hacking.</p>

As Dave Michaelson from the city of Asheville, NC put it: â€œ"Of all the conferences and or training I do, I learn more valuable applicable information in the three days of the CfA Summit than all the others combined. It sets the tone and mindset for a whole year of getting stuff done."</p>
