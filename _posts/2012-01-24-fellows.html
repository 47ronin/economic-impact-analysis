				<h3>Amir<span> Reavis-Bey</span></h3>
				<p>Amir spent more than seven years working as an investment banking technologist in New York City, developing an expertise in systems integration. As a CfA Fellow he helped the city of New Orleans address the chronic issue of blighted and abandoned properties. At the end of their Fellowship year, Amir and the New Orleans team founded a company to offer BlightStatus to other cities. As co-founder of Civic Industries, he’s now part of a new wave of technology start-ups that are helping government provide higher value to citizens at a far lower cost.</p>

				<h3>Ruthie<span> BenDor</span></h3>
				<p>Ruthie BenDor is a front-end developer and designer with experience at the nonprofit organizations GLAD and MassEquality. She founded and ran a 100+ member user group for the ExpressionEngine CMS, and spent summer 2011 riding her bicycle from Boston to San Francisco, interviewing people who work where government and technology converge and documenting the effort at CyclingCoder.com. As a fellow, Ruthie and the Santa Cruz team collaborated closely with Peter Koht, the city's Economic Development Coordinator, to make it easier for entrepreneurs to start local businesses. The resulting tool, OpenCounter, walks an aspiring small business owner through the complicated zoning codes, forms, and fees needed to apply for a business permit - and enables them to apply directly online.</p>

				<h3>Jesse<span> Bounds</span></h3>
				<p>Jesse Bounds is a software engineer with a decade of experience, including as the lead developer on Fluent, the first highly optimized news aggregator and reader for the iPhone. As a CfA Fellow on the Chicago team, he built tools to help cities make service requests – like broken streetlights or potholes – easier to manage and understand. Now Chicagoans can see the status of their requests throughout the process, as easily as they track packages through FedEx. He is now an engineer at Pivotal Labs in San Francisco.</p>
