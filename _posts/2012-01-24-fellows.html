					<h3>Amir<span> Reavis-Bey</span></h3>
					<p>Amir spent more than seven years working as an investment banking technologist in New York City, developing an expertise in systems integration. As a CfA Fellow he helped the city of New Orleans address the chronic issue of blighted and abandoned properties. At the end of their Fellowship year, Amir and the New Orleans team founded a company to offer BlightStatus to other cities. As co-founder of Civic Industries, he’s now part of a new wave of technology start-ups that are helping government provide higher value to citizens at a far lower cost.</p>

					<h3>Emily<span> Wright Moore</span></h3>

					<p>Emily Wright is a designer and graphic artist focused on usability and visual storytelling who has worked for several Bay Area groups, including Banned by the Bay, Red Ink Studios, and Intersection for the Arts. When Emily arrived for her residency, a devastating wildfire was fresh in the memory of many Austinites. Emily and her CfA team built Prepared.ly, a tool to help citizens prepare for wildfires, and ATX Floods, which tracks flash floods and emergency road closures. In 2013 she’s joining Recovers, one of the Code for America Accelerator’s 7 civic start-ups, as Chief Creative Officer.</p>

					<h3>Jesse<span> Bounds</span></h3>
					<p>Jesse Bounds is a software engineer with a decade of experience, including as the lead developer on Fluent, the first highly optimized news aggregator and reader for the iPhone. As a CfA Fellow on the Chicago team, he built tools to help cities make service requests – like broken streetlights or potholes – easier to manage and understand. Now Chicagoans can see the status of their requests throughout the process, as easily as they track packages through FedEx. He is now an engineer at Pivotal Labs in San Francisco.</p>
