	<div class="line"></div>
	<p class="blurb">Local governments are changing. Forward-thinking public servants across the country are leveraging technology to innovate the way our cities work — and it’s accelerated by the exchange of ideas, solutions, best practices, and even software code between like-minded leaders. Cities are now appointing Chief Data Officers and Chief Innovation Officers; they are redeploying each other’s apps; and they are working together to take on common policy challenges. This new network of civic leaders is showing that real change is possible from inside city hall.</p>
	<p class="blurb"> The Code for America Peer Network is a professional learning network for local government innovators who share the common goal of taking innovation in their city to the next level. Through the Peer Network, Code for America connects local governments around the country to facilitate peer learning, collaborative problem-solving, and the spread of innovation best practices between cities.</p>
