            <p>When you're hungry or homeless or just need some help an easy and reliable way to find the food, shelter, or services you require is essential. In San Mateo County residents often had to rely on knowledgeable service providers to find out when, how, and where to find services &mdash; and service providers had to rely on a paper booklet updated and distributed just once a year. This system not only created a bottle neck but often resulted in dissemination of outdated information.</p><br>
            <p>Working with the San Mateo County Human Services Agency, the Fellows created an app to put the data -- that traditionally populated the paper booked -- into a truly helpful, available to all, and up-to-date format: SMC Connect. This app asks one simple question: "What are you looking for?" And with that, returns relevant, accurate information. The app is powered by an API, which makes this social service data publicly available to any technologist interested in building another app for the county. The Fellows also standardized the data's format, which is likely to be adopted as a national data specification for municipalities everywhere.</p><br>
            <p>The true genius behind this application is that service providers have the ability to update the information about their organization &mdash; so information will stay current and no one ever has to arrive at a closed sign.</p>

But they reached them just by bringing in fresh eyes and adopting a simple, easy-to-use approach."</strong><br><em> Beverly Beasley Johnson,<br> Director of the San Mateo County Human Services Agency</em></p>
