			<div class="line"></div>
			<p class="blurb">The past few decades have seen staggering advances in technology, but government has been left behind, saddled with outdated and inefficient software, while costs have exploded into the hundreds of billions. New technology and start-ups, however, are emerging to create a new marketplace for civic innovation -- one that not only saves governments time and money, but also helps them connect and engage with citizens in new ways.</p>
			<p class="blurb">The <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator/" target="_blank">Code for America Accelerator</a> recruits “civic start-ups” and turbo-charges them with a national platform to raise awareness, a wealth of business training and advice, and a broad network of potential investors and civic leaders.</p>

				 		<p>Aunt Bertha picks up where Uncle Sam left off by simplifying the search and application process for these programs. We collect information on federal, state, county, city, neighborhood and nonprofit programs and put it all in one place. In just a few seconds, users can enter basic information and find programs relevant to their needs. Currently, Aunt Bertha has rolled out this search service to the State of Texas (roughly 1/12 of the American population) and is preparing to scale nationwide.</p>

We can get data off of paper and into a digital spreadsheet quickly and cheaply, taking care of the data entry so you don’t have to! We’re not an optical character recognition (OCR) service.
