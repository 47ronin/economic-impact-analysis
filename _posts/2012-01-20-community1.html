	<p class="blurb">In times of shrinking budgets and higher demands on government, it is essential to find new ways for local government to operate. Citizens are showing they can take on more responsibility and governments are seeing the community as capacity to help with things such as digging out fire hydrants in the snow, helping shape city plans and designs, and even rewriting government websites.</p>
	<p class="blurb">The <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/" target="_blank">Code for America Brigade</a> provides a national platform to help these groups come together, and for others, the tools and resources to start a local chapter in their community. This growing network of civic leaders is working to redefine the notion of citizenship at the local level.</p>

					<h5>Race for Reuse Winners, City of Anchorage</h5>
					<p>CfA challenged Brigades and civic hacker everywhere to deploy one of four open source, civic engagement apps, by Election Day. Then, teams were challenged get as many people using the apps as possible by December 8. The results were astounding: 31 civic apps in 28 cities. The winning effort was the redeployment of Adopt-a-Hydrant in Anchorage, AK. With the support of Anchorage CIO Lance Ahern, Becky Boone, a program analyst at an IT firm in Anchorage by day and member of Anchorage’s CfA Brigade in her spare time, led the effort to stand up Adopt-a-Hydrant, getting citizens to agree to dig out their adopted hydrants when they’re covered by snow. By year's end, 191 of the fire hydrants in Anchorage were adopted by citizens.</p>
