			<p class="blurb">In times of shrinking budgets and higher demands on government, it is essential to find new ways for local government to operate. Citizens are showing they can take on more responsibility and governments are seeing the community as capacity to help with things such as digging out fire hydrants in the snow, helping shape city plans and designs, and even rewriting government websites.</p>
			<p class="blurb">The <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/" target="_blank">Code for America Brigade</a> provides a national platform to help these groups come together, and for others, the tools and resources to start a local chapter in their community. This growing network of civic leaders is working to redefine the notion of citizenship at the local level.</p>

					<h3>Jeffrey<span> Johnson</span></h3>
					<h5>Brigade Captain, City of San Diego</h5>
					<p>Jeffrey Johnson has thrived as a public advocate for our movement, repeatedly standing before his city council to advocate for civic tech innovation, open government, and Code for America. He got his start with OpenSanDiego two years ago, standing up apps with OpenGeo tools (specifically GeoNode) to make county GIS data easier to access. He attends meetings with local city and regional government and hosts Brigade events all while holding down a job as a software developer at OpenGeo, where he’s part of the GeoNode team, and raising a family.</p>

					<h5>Race for Reuse Winners,</h5>
					<h5>City of Anchorage</h5>
					<p>CfA challenged Brigades and civic hackers everywhere to deploy one of four open-source civic apps by Election Day. Then, teams were challenged to get as many people using the apps as possible by December 8. The results were astounding: 31 civic apps in 28 cities. The winning effort was the redeployment of Adopt-a-Hydrant in Anchorage, Ala. With the support of Anchorage CIO Lance Ahern (far right), volunteer Becky Boone (middle) led the effort to stand up Adopt-a-Hydrant, getting citizens to agree to dig out their adopted hydrants when they’re covered in snow. By year's end, 191 of the fire hydrants in Anchorage were adopted by residents.</p>
