              <p>The City of Oakland receives a huge volume of public records requests. City employees strove to respond to request in a timely manner, but  struggled with the quantity of and the encumbering processes in place. The process created duplicative work and was difficult from staff to track outstanding inquiries &mdash; and it was confusing for users. As a result, tensions arose between residents and the City over request compliance.</p>
              <p>The 2013 Fellows worked with the City to build RecordTrac to streamline the records request process &mdash; for residents and city employees. That tool creates a searchable archive of past requests and responses, a simple form to make a new request, and a tool to track the status of a request. More than 2,000 requests had been made through the new tool by year's end.</p>
              <p>By bringing transparency to the system, saving city staff time and improving responses, RecordTrac is a step to repair the relationship between residents and City Hall around transparency and public information.</p>
