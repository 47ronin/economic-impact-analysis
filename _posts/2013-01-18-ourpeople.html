					<p>Garry J. Bonelli was sworn in to the Board of Port Commissioners on January 3, 2014, to represent the City of Coronado. A retired Navy SEAL and Rear Admiral, Bonelli culminated 45 years of active and reserve service in 2013 at the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command headquartered in Coronado. From his command, he provided the vision and leadership for a 9,000-person worldwide maritime special operations force and directed a $1 billion enterprise. Bonelli’s concurrent civilian professional career spanned corporate, military and public policy development. He has served the region as an executive staff member of the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), and as vice president of communications and vice president of military affairs for the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce. Bonelli helped create both the 1987 and 2004 communications programs that garnered voter approval and a subsequent extension of TransNet, a $14 billion countywide sales tax for transportation. Bonelli holds a master of science degree in mass communications from San Diego State University.</p>
