  <h2>A call to service.</h2>
  <p>21st century government needs 21st century thinking and skills. Coders and designers from the fast-paced technology industry want to make a difference. Leaders in local governments want to innovate.</p>
  <p>The Code for America Fellowship pairs small tech teams giving a year of service with cities and counties eager for new approaches, stewarding them through a structured year of building apps, piloting user-centered design and lean start-up techniques.</p>
  <p> The success of the Fellowship is measured not in lines of code, but in sustainable, meaningful change. It's about proving that government can move at the speed of citizens, can speak the language of citizens, and can cost what citizens are willing to pay.</p>
