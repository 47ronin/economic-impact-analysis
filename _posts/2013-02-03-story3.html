            <p>Textizen is helping communities from coast to coast lend a listening ear to residents, students, parents, and individuals everywhere who deserve their say. Just this year Textizen asked Tampa, Fla. resided whether or not to add an elevated roadway to reduce traffic congestion and provide evacuation routes (the majority does), the team worked with Chicago Public School to gather input for it's 10-year facilities master plan, and they helped teach the students of Rex Putnam High School about mental illness -- inspiring them to learn more about it, and aid ailing classmates.</p>

            <p>Born from the 2012 Fellowship and founded as a civic startup just a year ago, with the aid of CfA's Incubator, Textizen is already making strides in civic tech. The team's worked with more than 40 cities and the tool's sent more than 25,000 texts.</p>

            <p>Textizen is now available in Spanish and will soon launch a new tool: Campaigns -- to keep people engaged and ongoing conversation.

              <p><strong>"Iâ€™ve been very pleased with the results. As you may know, projects to add lanes on Gandy Blvd have been very controversial locally for more than a decade.  Textizen was a great tool to get a quick read on community opinion."</strong><br><em>Beth Alden, Assistant Executive Director at Hillsborough Metropolitan Planning Organization</em></p><br>
