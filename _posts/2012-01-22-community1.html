	<h3 class="headline">Building Community as Capacity</h3>
	<div class="line"></div>
	<p class="blurb">In times of shrinking budgets and higher demands on government, it is essential to find new ways for local government to operate. Citizens are showing they can take on more responsibility and governments are seeing the community as capacity to help with things such as digging out fire hydrants in the snow, helping shape city plans and designs, and even rewriting government websites.</p>
	<p class="blurb">The Brigade provides a national platform to help these groups come together, and for others, the tools and resources to start a local chapter in their community. This growing network of civic leaders is working to redefine the notion of citizenship at the local level..</p>
