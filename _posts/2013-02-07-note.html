            <p>Twenty-nine fellows and sixty-five alumni, hundreds of partners in local government, thousands of active brigade members, and now over a dozen civic startups&mdash;together we found new ways to transform our communities and refine our vision of what government by the people, for the people, and of the people means in the 21st century. </p>
            <p>This year, they have shown us that what began four years ago as an experiment in helping governments work better has now grown into a national and international movement of technologists working on things that matter.</p>
            <p>Each community and each program grew and matured, and we officially welcomed communities from around the world for the first time! Now more than ever, people around the world are coding the communities they want to live in.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Hereâ€™s to all we can do together in 2014.</p>
