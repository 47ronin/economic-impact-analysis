        <p>The Port of San Diego is indeed a regional economic engine, supported by a new report that shows the Port had a total economic impact of $7.6 billion on the San Diego region in 2013.</p>
        
        <p>The District is an important location for employment in the region, with 33,000 jobs located on the tidelands, generating $4.4 billion in direct economic output.</p>
        
        <p>An additional 24,600 jobs and $3.2 billion in indirect and induced output are generated in San Diego County based on the goods and services purchased by businesses and organizations located on District property and their employees.</p> 
        <p>“The Port of San Diego could not exist without its partners,” said Robert “Dukie” Valderrama, Port Commissioner. “Because of them, the Port is able to fulfill its mission and its roles as an economic engine, community service provider, environmental steward and provider of public safety.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>We look forward to continuing a tradition of excellence in public service.</p>
