				<h3>Ruthie<span> BenDor</span></h3>
				<p>Ruthie BenDor is a front-end developer and designer who worked for GLAD and MassEquality and founded a 100+ member user group for the ExpressionEngine CMS. As a Fellow, Ruthie and the Santa Cruz, Calif. team collaborated closely with Economic Development Coordinator Peter Koht to make it easier for entrepreneurs to start local businesses. The resulting tool, <a href="http://opencounter.cityofsantacruz.com/" target="_blank">OpenCounter</a>, walks an aspiring small business owner through the complicated zoning codes, forms, and fees needed to apply for a business permit – and enables them to apply directly online. Ruthie's now a design technologist at fuseproject.</p>

				<h3>Jesse<span> Bounds</span></h3>
