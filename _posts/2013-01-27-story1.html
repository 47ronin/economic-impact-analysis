            <p>Outdated and inefficient government systems take the greatest toll on the vulnerable individuals who most rely on public services. In 2013, after seeing clients struggle with the CalFresh (food assistance) system, the SF Human Services Agency partnered with CfA Fellows to become the first agency to text message clients if their benefits were at risk of expiring. Within the first month of launch of the app, Promptly, over half of the clients who received a text message contacted their caseworkers to avoid losing their food assistance.</p>

Promptly helps us achieve this by enabling beneficiaries of programs like CalFresh to keep food on the table for their families.”</strong><br><em> San Francisco Mayor, Ed Lee</em></p>
