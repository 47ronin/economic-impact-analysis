      <p>In 2012, Code for America went from being an interesting experiment to a proven engine of change.  The organization made this transition because of thousands of people like you.  You proved that officials at all levels of government are eager for a new playbook, and that some of the brightest talents in technology and design are eager to work with them on it.  You proved that interfaces to government can be simple, beautiful, and easy to use, and that they need not cost more than citizens are willing to pay.   You proved that where governments lack capacity, the community can be that capacity.  You proved that government can work for the people, by the people, in the 21st century.</p> 
     
      <p>For all this, thank you.</p>
               
      <p>The two questions I am asked most often are “what can I do to help?” and “how will Code for America scale?”  They are the same question.  We will scale the way any successful network scales, with some basic protocols and a common purpose to bind us, and the creativity and hard work of every person who finds us and cares enough to make a difference.  The movement scales when everyone who believes that government is something that we do together finds a way to contribute, in his or her own way.  There are a hundred ways to make a difference, from writing code to unclogging a storm drain in Oakland, CA (where I live).</p>
