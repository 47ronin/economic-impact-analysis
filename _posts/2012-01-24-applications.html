	  <h3>Textizen</h3>			
	  <p>Citizen input is essential to the healthy functioning of any democracy, but the Philadelphia City Planning Commission lamented that many residents couldn’t make it to the few in-person meetings the agency could afford to hold, and that those who did often represented only vocal minorities.</p>
	  <p>In Philadelphia, 41% of residents don’t have access to broadband Internet at home, but over 90% have access to mobile phones with text messaging. The CfA Fellows designed, built and deployed Textizen, which uses posters and bus shelter ads to solicit hyper-local feedback via SMS, allowing an organization to create targeted surveys and collect responses via text message so that traditionally disenfranchised groups can participate. Other cities have taken note, and now the Fellows are starting a company to meet the demand. They've heard from more than 110 cities around the country, and are now working with 15, including Boston and Salt Lake City.</p>

	  <h3>Honolulu Answers</h3>			
      <p>CfA’s Honolulu team faced a near-impossible challenge. Nearly everyone they interviewed, inside City Hall as well as outside, wanted a better website. But with tens of thousands of pages of content owned by dozens of departments, the project was out of scope for a team of three in under a year. Undeterred, the Fellows mined the search logs of Honolulu.gov to find the most common searches, and then tried those top searches in live user testing with residents.</p>
      <p>They found that on the existing site people were unable to easily find the answers to these basic questions, like how to get and renew a driver's license. So the team built a simple, beautiful, easy-to-use interface they called Honolulu Answers, and wrote clear, plain language answers to a few of the most frequently asked questions. </p>
      <p>Then they tapped the power of the community to help the project grow. Early on a Saturday in July, more than 55 Honolulu residents came together to write simple, plain-language answers to dozens more of their top questions. At what may have been the first ever civic “write-a-thon,” this group not only created an invaluable public tool, they also created a community takes responsibility for their own access to government information and continues to maintain Honolulu Answers.</p>

	  <h3>BlightStatus</h3>			
	  <p>In New Orleans, both the city and countless community organizations are working to improve neighborhoods. But when the CfA Fellows arrived, the city’s systems kept data about blighted properties in separate silos, and community advocates had trouble getting accurate information. City officials estimated that fixing the problem would take about three years, and require expensive upgrades to several municipal IT systems.</p>
	  <p>The Fellows found all the relevant data, unified it, and made it accessible through a simple web and mobile interface. For the first time, anyone can type in an address in New Orleans and immediately see whether the property has been reported or inspected for blight, whether the owners have been notified, if there’s a hearing scheduled or a judgement that’s pending on the property. Citizens can also subscribe to receive instant alerts the moment the status changes on properties that they care about.</p>
	  <p>The tool took far less time to build than the city had expected. And citizens, neighborhood groups, and City Hall are no longer fighting about the data - instead, they’re working together to solve the problems. BlightStatus was celebrated by city staff, community groups, and the press for changing the conversation, and now the team is offering it to other cities who are interested.</p>
