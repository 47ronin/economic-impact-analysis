Design
---

This project uses a Sass preprocessor to help generate flexible CSS. Make visual adjustments to the .scss files and compile with Compass. Traverse into your project directory and:

    compass watch

Changes to Sass files will automatically trigger Compass to compile into the project’s css directory. Design, test, iterate, repeat. When everything looks complete, celebrate and:

    compass compile -e production
